# Luxtronik firmware analysis

## Motivation

I own a Alpha Innotec heatpump and wanted to integrate it into my Smart home.
As a natural born tinkerer It was clear that I'm going to reverse engeneer what ever possible in order to achive my goal ðŸ¤“

## Firmware updates

You can find the latest firmwar files here:

- [Alpha Innotec](https://www.heatpump24.com/DownloadArea.php?layout=1&lang=5)
- [Siemens Novelan](https://www.heatpump24.com/DownloadArea.php?layout=2&lang=5) 
- [CAT](https://www.heatpump24.com/DownloadArea.php?layout=3&lang=5)

The url is `https://www.heatpump24.com/DownloadArea.php?layout=1&lang=5` and by changing the `layout=` GET parameterfrom 1 to 2 or 3 you get the download menu for one of the three manufacturers.

## Heatpump models

See [MODELS.md](MODELS.md)

Generated by `heatpump_models.py` 

## Firmware download and decompression

Can be done using `luxtronik_firmware.sh`. Results in an extracted firmware in the `./firmware` subfolder, except for `software 0` (see [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for reference).

## Root password 

ðŸ˜Ž Yes, you can get the root password for your heatpump from a firmware update!
I'm not sure if that's true for every firmware update but at least a couple I've tested.

1. Download and extract the firmware using `luxtronik_firmware.sh`
2. Run `root_password.sh`

## SSH 

The heatpumps run a fairly old version of Dropbear SSH server which does not support state of the art crypto cyphers.
Therfore you have to specify a weak cipher in order to login.

Use `ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes256-cbc root@192.168.178.100` to get to the login prompt, be sure to replace `192.168.178.100` with the IP of your heatpump.

âš  ATTENTION âš  You are logged in as root which mean that you can easily destroy your heatpump. Be careful with waht you do!
